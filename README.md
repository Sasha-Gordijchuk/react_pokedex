  - [DEMO](https://sasha-gordijchuk.github.io/react_events-calendar/)

  - This is a calendar in which you can plan events for a certain date and time.

  - To create a new event, click on the '+' button in the upper left part of the application. After that, enter the necessary data in the modal window: title (required), description, date (required), time.

  - Also, the user can cyclically change the month or select it manually in the upper right part. Monthly data is stored in localStorage and is persisted on page reloads.

  - Saved events are also stored in localStorage and displayed in a cell with the date specified when the event was created. Clicking on an event opens a modal window in which the user can edit this event.
